Initial design would be named "breaking bad" after the TV show. This is because, the show was about change or the evolution of Walter. I relate to this because as a full-stack developer or developer in general, to stay relevant, one needs to constantly evolve with the times. Subsequent designs would be named after [Marvel movies](https://www.space.com/marvel-movies-in-order).
